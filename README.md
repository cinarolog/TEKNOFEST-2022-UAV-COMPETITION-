TEKNOFEST 2022 UAV Competition
Welcome to the TEKNOFEST 2022 UAV Competition repository! This repository contains the resources, code, and documentation related to the participation in the TEKNOFEST 2022 UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) competition. It demonstrates the integration of state-of-the-art technologies such as YOLOv5 for object detection in UAV applications.

üìÇ Repository Structure
1. YOLO-V5
Contains configurations and implementations for YOLOv5.
Includes custom model training, dataset preparation, and inference scripts for UAV-based object detection.
2. .gitattributes
Specifies file attribute configurations for Git.
3. .gitignore
Defines ignored files to maintain a clean repository and avoid unnecessary uploads.
üöÄ Key Features
YOLOv5 Integration: Utilized for real-time object detection and recognition.
Custom Dataset: Adapted to UAV-specific requirements for precision in aerial imagery.
Scalable Codebase: Optimized for deployment on UAVs with limited computational power.
